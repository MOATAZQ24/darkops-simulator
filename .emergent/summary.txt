The trajectory outlines the initial stages of developing DarkOps Lab, a cybersecurity attack simulator. The AI engineer received comprehensive project requirements, environmental constraints, and an initial boilerplate codebase. After confirming an implementation plan with the user, the AI engineer successfully completed Phase 1: Backend and Database Setup. This involved designing MongoDB schemas and implementing FastAPI endpoints for session management, attack data, user progress, and quizzes, confirmed by a 100% successful backend test. Subsequently, Phase 2: Core UI & Layout was initiated and largely completed. Framer Motion was installed, and the React frontend was structured with new components for a dark/neon themed layout, dashboard, and attack detail pages. Screenshots confirmed the successful rendering of the UI, demonstrating the main dashboard and a sample attack detail page. The current state is that the backend is robust, and the core frontend UI is functional, awaiting user confirmation for frontend testing and progression to animated simulations.

<product_requirements>
The DarkOps Lab is a cybersecurity attack simulator designed with a dark, neon, hacker-style UI, implemented using React and Tailwind CSS for responsiveness. Key features include a sidebar/navbar categorizing attacks (Network, Web/App, Malware, Social Engineering, Wireless/IoT, Cryptographic, Insider/APT, Cloud). Each attack should have a dedicated page featuring a Simulation Panel (preferably animated), a Step-by-Step Flow, and Defense Strategies. Animations are prioritized for high-impact attacks (e.g., network flows, malware propagation), while simpler attacks may use static representations. The application must include a search bar and an interactive Quiz Mode with hints and explanations to reinforce learning. A DarkOps Console for terminal-like command simulations is also required. All attack data will originate from an  file. Crucially, MongoDB integration is required to persist user progress, quiz scores, and interactive activity, supporting future features like leaderboards and user profiles. The design emphasizes modular, well-documented code for deployment.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a full-stack architecture comprising a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, connected to a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   : **New file.** Created to store mock data for attack simulations. This file serves as the initial data source for various attack types, their details, and related information.
-   : The main FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily modified to include new Pydantic models (, , , ), a  router for DarkOps Lab functionalities, and API endpoints for:
        -   : Retrieve all attacks.
        -   : Retrieve a specific attack.
        -   : Create a new user session.
        -   : Get user progress.
        -   : Update user progress for an attack.
        -   : Save quiz results.
        -   The file also includes MongoDB connection setup using  and  configuration.
    -   **Importance**: This file now serves as the central hub for all backend logic, data retrieval, and persistence, supporting the core features of the DarkOps Lab.
-   : Manages frontend dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was added as a dependency to enable advanced UI animations.
    -   **Importance**: Ensures all necessary frontend libraries are available.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed Phase 1 (Backend & Database Setup) and largely completed Phase 2 (Core UI & Layout) of the DarkOps Lab application.

In Phase 1, the backend () was extensively modified to introduce new FastAPI endpoints and Pydantic models for managing attack data, user sessions, progress tracking, and quiz results. A mock  file was created to provide initial data. Backend testing confirmed all new endpoints were working flawlessly with a 100% pass rate. This ensures robust data persistence for user progress and quiz scores in MongoDB, supporting a personalized learning experience.

In Phase 2, the frontend was significantly enhanced.  was installed for future animations. Key React components were created:  for session management,  for the main application structure with a dark/neon theme,  to display user statistics,  to show specific attack information with tab navigation (Simulation, Step-by-Step, Defenses, Quiz), and  as a placeholder. The main  was updated to incorporate these new components and set up  for navigation.

The current state of the product is a functional frontend UI with a dark/neon aesthetic, a visible dashboard with placeholder stats, and navigable attack detail pages (e.g., DDoS Attack page with tabs). The backend is fully capable of supporting data persistence for sessions, attacks, progress, and quizzes. The UI is visually complete for the main layout and navigation, as confirmed by recent screenshots.
